# list and tuple both are same but list is mutable and tuple is immutable.
# String is immutable.
#  mutable means if you can create a variable then you can change everything. 
#  immutable means if you can create a variable then you can not change anything.

# tuple :- A built in data type that lets us create immutable sequence of values.

# tuple create with () but list create [].

tup =(2,1,3,4,5)
# print(type(tup))

print(tup[0])

# tup[0]=7 it is not valid for tuple

# tupl =(1,) if create a single tuole then always create with comma because if only write one element then python under stand integer.

# slicing same as list.

print(tup[0:3])
